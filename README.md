# Mahjong Solitaire

Requires the latest [CE C libraries](tiny.cc/clibs)

To install, you will need TI-Connect CE or TILP.  
Transfer the C libraries, MAHJONG.8xp, and KYODAI.8xv

### Running the Kyodai script (not necessary):  
You'll need [ti83f](https://bitbucket.org/keoni29/ti83f) and python 3.  
From the command line, run:
```
python3 kyodai.py NAME file1.lay file2.lay file3.lay ...
```  
which will produce an appvar called NAME.8xv containing all layouts with the correct number of tiles.

### Building from Source:
Building from source is not necessary to run Mahjong - a pre-built copy (MAHJONG.8xp) is included.  
You should only build from source if you want to modify the source code of the game.  
You will need the [CE C toolchain](https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain/releases).  
From the command line, `cd` to the `source` directory and run
```
make gfx
make
```
The output program can be found at `bin/MAHJONG.8xp`.

### CREDITS:
Thanks to MateoC for creating the C toolchain and putting up with my stupidity.
